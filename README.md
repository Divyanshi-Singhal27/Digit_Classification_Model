ðŸ“– About the Project

This project involves building a digit classification system that can recognize handwritten digits using a machine learning model. The objective is to achieve high accuracy using feature engineering and model optimization techniques.


---

ðŸ—‚ Dataset

Name: MNIST Handwritten Digit Dataset

Source: Kaggle / TensorFlow Datasets

Size: 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images (28x28 grayscale)



---

ðŸ›  Technologies Used

Python

NumPy, Pandas

Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / Keras (based on your implementation)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

Jupyter Notebook

âš™ How it Works

1. Data Preprocessing: Normalization, reshaping, and splitting dataset


2. Model Building: [e.g., CNN using Keras / SVM using scikit-learn]


3. Training: Fit the model on training data


4. Evaluation: Accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report


5. Prediction: Classifying unseen digit images
